## ICM2020 Prompt D

This was in response to the the first week of the 2020 COMAP Competition. Our final
paper was written in LaTeX and uploaded as a pdf to the repository as "Comap2020Writeup.pdf".

Our main code (Linkfinders.py) is included as well, which has several functions I built 
to genererate data, which is shown in our pdf document. 

The original problem, data,and solutions can be found here.

## Stack
For this project  I used Pandas, networkX, seaborn, and matplotlib.

This was my first time working with the more data-science aspect of python
so I would do a lot different if I did it again. NetworkX was essential to moddeling the 
team via graph theory, and that package is built ontop of pandas. 

Seaborn was used in a few instances to create 2D historgrams that looked a little nicer
then what I could create in matplotlib.

## After Note
This project consisted of a fair ammount of research as none of us were immediately familiar with the topics.
Yasmine and Andrew did a lot of the researching while I was responsible for all of the code. This project would 
not of been possible without the help of everyone.
