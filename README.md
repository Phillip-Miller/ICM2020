ICM2020 Prompt D

This was in response to the the first week of the 2020 COMAP Competition. Our final
paper was written in LaTeX but we uploaded it to the repository for reading. This code 
was written in one weekend, but because the competition is now over we decided to make it public.

The Original Data Given is in the file labeled 2020_Problem_D_Data which is unmodified from the original 
data we recived. Our main code (Linkfinders.py) is included as well, which has several functions we built 
to genererate data, which is shown in our pdf document.
